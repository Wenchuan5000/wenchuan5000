### Welcome to Wenchuan's World!

Hello, my name is Zhao Wenchuan (in which "Zhao" is the last name), and I am a designer, working for UI/UX and graphic designs. This is the first website coded by myself, and I name it NEW WORLD according to Minecraft tradition. Mmmm... What should I say next? Well, hard. Let's see what I can do first!

2019 A.D.

### I am an UI/UX designer

I was a painter working at home alone five years ago, until Lu Shu told me I should have been working on something new, like design an app, or website, or something, WITH PEOPLE. Well, then I have been working as an UI/UX designers for over 5 years, and I think I'll continue to do that for decades and decades!

#### Web Design

In this part of my gallery, you will see several design projects for websites, including this GitHub page. Since I can code a little bit, I began to prepare a new website for my math notes, and... Nobody can stop me to make webs oh yeah!

#### App Design

Designing for apps on mobile is just like designing a little game, it's lovely.

### Isometric toys

I am going to put the whole world into my .sketch file in a Minecraft view!

### Icons

An icon is a religious work of art... Well, what am I talking about?

### Vector toys

When I am too lazy to pick up a brush, I will grab my magic mouse, to "paint" some toys for myself.

### Technical Drawings

I had been focus on drawing technical drawings for years before I became an UI/UX designer. This experience really helps, because it also needs "pixel perfection".

### Mosaic

I love mosaic, from Ancient Greece to contemporary. I made some with Lu Shu, with papers, marbles, and pixels.

### Printings

## I am a math enthusiast

I barely knew about trigonometry a year ago. One day, when I was listening a lecture about the story between Leibniz and Newton, I found I couldn't be satisfied by only story anymore, I want to know more about science. Euclid's Elements was the first text book I downloaded from Gutenberg Project. And after I could handle analytic geometry, I also learn calculus. Now I am reading Mathematical Analysis by Elias Zakon. Mathematics brings me the happiness I never experienced!
