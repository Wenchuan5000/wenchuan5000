# About

My name is **Zhao Wenchuan** (趙文川) from Shanghai, China. I am a **UI/UX designer** with over 5 years experience. And this is my first personal website I designed and coded alone. And now, I am looking for a new job, seeking a new team and a new project. I hope I can finally focus on doing something truly amazing!

It has been a long journey. I have spent at least months on building this site -- although I also spent a lot of time on learning coding, traveling, reading books, trancing... during these months -- so, I am so glad that I can finally start to write this *About* as the last scene of the very this first version of personal project.

I have uploaded some of my works during the last 5 years, but as I am looking for a new job, I still think the information below might be useful.

## PS (not so important maybe)

This is the first time I code a website all alone. The design is okay, and the responsiveness of the website is perfectly coded (that is what I am proud of this time) according to my design. But, still, I also found the codes became more and more chaotic during the work -- that is the cost of the "first time".

To make things better, I already prepared a new repository ([Wenchuan-Design](https://github.com/Wenchuan-Design/Wenchuan-Design.github.io)) on GitHub to redesign and recode my personal website. I hope the new one can be more elegant on coding as well as UI/UX style. And further, I also hope the new CSS can be somewhat used by others.
