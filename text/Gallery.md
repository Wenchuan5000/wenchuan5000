# Welcome to my gallery!

Welcome! This is the place I stock my works. I picked some UI/UX projects and graphic designs of mine since 2015, the year I got my first job in a company focus on teaching English on mobile. Some of them are designed for companies, others are just for satisfying the desire to create.

## Something I'm proud of

Here is some something I'm proud of. I give them this special place to display not only because I like the design, but also because some of them are made with interesting and creative people.

# UI/UX design

UI/UX design is just like architecture design, you need to pay great effort on finding the beautiful proportion, and the proper way of interaction. It is such a joyful work, and it takes you. I always imagine I am building a cathedral or a chapel while I am sketching the layout of a website or an app -- the Pillars of Eternity is one of my favorite novel. These are some of my previous works, not perfect, but I like them.

# Sketch book

I am still editing this page. I wanted to pick some of casually drawn sketch of mine, to give a more personal image of how I work. But, obviously, this is not an easy task...
