# Welcome to my world

Welcome to my world, my name is Zhao Wenchuan, a UI/UX designer have over 5 years experience from Shanghai, China. And this is the first website not only designed by me, and also coded by myself alone. In this site, you will see some works of mine, hope enjoy :)


### My gallery

I picked some UI/UX projects and graphic designs of mine since 2015, the year I got my first job in a company focus on teaching English on mobile.

### About me

When and where I was born, educational experience, Work experience, personal and career plan, etc.

<!--## Introduction

In Jan 2019, I resigned my last job and stayed at home for several months. During this long vacation, I continued to learn mathematical analysis, and started to learn HTML and CSS. I learn everything quickly as well as learning coding. As soon as I found the fun of coding, I started to design my first website, which is this, Wenchuan5000.github.io.

Now, I have spent about 3 months on building this website, and uploading my works. It is the first time I do it alone, so the code files became a little bit chaotic at last, that I should re-code after the first version is published. But, still, it was a happy task, and I have pushed this site into pixel-perfect according to my `.sketch` file. I love it!

Sincerely, Wenchuan

## I am a UI/UX and visual designer

Before I became a UI/UX designer, I was an illustrator, working on canvas, paper or screens. Since last 5 years, I began to design for internet, as a job, and as a hobby. I love it because I think it a great transformation from traditional publishing into a new realm, with so may new possibilities.

### UI/UX design

I always imagine I am building a cathedral or a chapel while I am sketching the layout of a website or an app -- Pillars of Eternity is one of my favorite novel.

### Visual design

Inspired by Ancient Roman Art, Ukiyo-e, and Minecraft.

## About this site

In Jan 2019, I resigned my last job and stayed at home for several months. During this long vacation, I continued to learn mathematical analysis, and started to learn HTML and CSS -- including some basic JavaScript I used in this site. Then, I started to design my first website, which is this, Wenchuan5000.github.io.

I have spent about 3 months on building this website, including uploading my works, and I have pushed site into "pixel-perfect" according to my `.sketch` file. But it is also the first time I do it alone, so it became a little bit chaotic on coding at last. Now, I am ready to recode this site and ready to design some new elements for it. I hope you will like it :)
