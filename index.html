      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>ONE · 一个 is a quit old project. The ver. 1.0 was updated 10 years ago (I guess), designed by another Designer. Years later, in 2016, I was invited to redesigned the whole app. This is the first time I handle the design of an app as a team leader (I had two team mates at at time, one for the icon, and another for the UX animation), so the design may seems naive, but still I love it. This file was lay in my iMac for over 2 years, now I think I should show it to you guys, hope enjoy!</p>

      <p>Allow me to introduce my UI design with my favorites Ukiyo-e.</p>
      <h2>ONE Notes</h2>
      <p>I like notes, and I like write notes, whatever it is about, a trip, a book, or math notes. And no doubt, ONE Notes is my favorite thing in ONE (the original file was start whit the printmakings by Horishige and Hokusai, so at last, the best use of ONE Notes is to share Ukiyo-e, I guess). It was imerged in ONE v1.0, far earlier than I began to handle v4.0. But, unlike the colorful interface style in v1.0, I changed the style into black and white, inspire by the real paper note cards.</p>
      <h2>Text Style Sheet</h2>
      <p>Designing text style is the happiest thing during work, I can do this all day! In the designing of ONE, I designed my very first test style sheet. In iOS version, it is mainly composed by light fonts, in family PingFang, a safe fonts for symblified Chinese in apple devices --  we didn&#39;t have much money to buy fonts at that time :(</p>
      <h2>Colors</h2>
      <p>Colors are designed as less as possible, because I wanted people to know that this app is about reading, and was designed with the respect to tradition. I gave 7 steps of grays, besides white and black.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Style Sheet of Night-mode</h2>
      <p>In fact, I bearly spent time on night-mode, since every color was designed base on the same rgb value (0, 0, 0) with the only difference on alpha value. So, the whole progress of the designing of night-mode is something like this: I tell engineers, &quot;Please change every rgb color with 0, 0, 0, into 225, 225, 225, and keep the alpha value as they were.&quot; then they are done. But, to be honest, I awared this is not such good idea now.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Some Examples of Night-mode</h2>
      <p>Personaly, I don&#39;t like this night-mode so much, since I did lazy work on the design. But surprisingly, my friends and, as it was told, some uses love this mode. Well, surprisingly...</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Launchings and Gods</h2>
      <p>In ONE, I designed several eggs, but only one had been coded, which is these, Launchings and Gods. Everyday in a week, you turn on this app, and you&#39;ll see a special god of this day. This is inspired by the naming of the days, for example Mecury for Monday, Apollo for Sunday, etc..</p>
