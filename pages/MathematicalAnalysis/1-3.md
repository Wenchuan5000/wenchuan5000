## §§ 1-3. Sets and Operations on Sets. Quantifiers

A *set* is a collection of objects of any specified kind. Sets are usually denoted by capitals. The objects belonging to a set are called its *elements* or *members*. We write $x\in A​$ if $x​$ is a member of $A​$, and $x \notin A​$ if it is not.

$A=\{ a,b,c,... \}​$ means that $A​$ consists of the elements $a, b, c, ...​$. In particular, $A = \{a,b\}​$ consists of $a​$ and $b​$; $A=\{p\}​$ consists of $p​$ alone. The *empty* or *void* set, $\emptyset​$, has *no* elements. Equality ($=​$) means a logical identity.

If all members of $A$ are also in $B$, we call $A$ a *subset* of $B$ (and $B$ a *superset* of $A$), and write $A \subseteq B$ or $B \supseteq A$. It is an axiom that *the sets $A$ and $B$ are equal $(A=B)$ if they have the same members*, i.e.,

$$
A\subseteq B \;\; and \;\; B \subseteq A.
